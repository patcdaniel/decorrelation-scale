Estimate the spatial variability of the temporal decorrelation scale of temperature values that are derived from different ocean models.

It is presumed that decorrelation time scales will be much longer offshore versus nearshore, but it is unknown how much they vary between different models i.e. CAROMS and WCOFS. Further it would be interesting to see how that scale varies at different depth bins.
